# A* Graph Pathfinding  Defold native extension

A high-performance A* pathfinding library written in C++11, designed for real-time games and simulations with hundreds to thousands of moving objects. Built with a focus on performance, using flat array data structures and advanced caching mechanisms.

## Technical Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for real-time pathfinding with hundreds to thousands of moving objects  
- **A* Algorithm**: Classic A* with heuristics for optimal and efficient pathfinding  
- **Flat Array Architecture**: Cache-friendly memory layout using `dmArray<T>` from the Defold SDK  
- **Path Caching**: LRU cache with version-based invalidation for frequently reused paths  
- **Projected Pathfinding**: Supports pathfinding from arbitrary positions, not limited to graph nodes  
- **Dynamic Graph Updates**: Add or remove nodes and edges at runtime with automatic cache invalidation  
- **Min-Heap Priority Queue**: Custom implementation with zero-copy memory pooling and bulk operations  
- **Distance Caching**: Spatial hashing for fast approximate distance lookups  
- **No STL Containers**: Uses `dmArray<T>` and `dmHashTable<T>` for all data structures  
- **Memory Pre-allocation**: All arrays are pre-allocated at initialization; pathfinding uses only pre-allocated memory  
- **No Exceptions**: Uses explicit error codes instead of C++ exceptions

### Available Platforms

- **Desktop**: Linux (x86_64, arm64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), Windows (x86_64)
- **Mobile**: iOS (arm64, x86_64), Android (armv7, arm64)
- **Web**: JavaScript, WebAssembly (via Emscripten)


### Smoothing Methods:

| Method | Best For | Characteristics |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| `circular_arc()` | ‚≠ê Railroads, tower defense, tile-based games | **Perfect circular arcs** for corners - ideal for tile matching |
| `bezier_quadratic()` | Character movement, vehicles | Straight segments stay straight, only corners smoothed |
| `bezier_adaptive()` | Dynamic paths, varying turn angles | Adaptive control point placement based on corner sharpness |
| `catmull_rom()` | Precise waypoint following | Passes through all waypoints |
| `bezier_cubic()` | Cinematic cameras, UI | Maximum smoothness with two control points |

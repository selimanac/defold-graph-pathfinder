# A* Graph Pathfinding Defold Native Extension

A high-performance A* pathfinding library written in C++11, designed for real-time games and simulations with hundreds to thousands of moving objects. Built with a focus on performance, using flat array data structures and advanced caching mechanisms.


## Discussions & Release Notes

## Documentation

For detailed function descriptions and usage examples:  

- [Path API Reference](./API.md).
- [Navmesh API Reference](./NAVMESH_API.md).

## Installation

You can use this extension in your own project by adding it as a [Defold library dependency](https://defold.com/manuals/libraries/#setting-up-library-dependencies).  
Open your `game.project` file, select `Project`, and add a stable version from the [releases](https://github.com/selimanac/defold-graph-pathfinder/releases) page to the `Dependencies` field.

## Examples

- Tiny City: https://github.com/selimanac/defold-tiny-city

## Status

This library consists of three parts:

### Pathfinder

The core library. Responsible for managing nodes, edges, and performing pathfinding.

✅ Projected Pathfinding  
✅ Static Navmesh Pathfinding  
✅ Min-Heap Priority Queue  
✅ Path Caching  
✅ Distance Caching  


### Path Smoothing

Responsible for existing path smoothing.  
Currently available smoothing options:  

✅ Quadratic Bézier  
✅ Adaptive Bézier  
✅ Catmull–Rom  
✅ Cubic Bézier  
✅ Circular Arc

### Navigation

Responsible for enabling agents to navigate along the path.

🚧 **Path Following** - WIP  
🚧 **Dynamic Nodes for Agents**  
🚧 **Path Invalidation for Agents**  
🚧 **Group Assignment for Agents**  
🚧 **Group Formation Patterns**  
❌ **Collision Avoidance** — Not planned, maybe in the future



## Supported Platforms

- **Desktop**: Linux (x86_64, arm64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), Windows (x86_64)
- **Mobile**: iOS (arm64, x86_64), Android (armv7, arm64)
- **Web**: JavaScript, WebAssembly (via Emscripten)

x86-win32 is not supported.

## Technical Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for real-time pathfinding with hundreds to thousands of moving objects  
- **A* Algorithm **: Classic A* with heuristics for optimal and efficient pathfinding  
- **Flat Array Architecture**: Cache-friendly memory layout using `dmArray<T>` from the Defold SDK  
- **Path Caching**: LRU cache with version-based invalidation for frequently reused paths  
- **Projected Pathfinding**: Supports pathfinding from arbitrary positions, not limited to graph nodes  
- **Spatial Index for Large Graphs**: Grid-based spatial indexing for 10-100× speedup in large graphs (>500 nodes)  
- **Dynamic Graph Updates**: Add or remove nodes and edges at runtime with automatic cache invalidation  
- **Min-Heap Priority Queue**: Custom implementation with zero-copy memory pooling and bulk operations  
- **Distance Caching**: Spatial hashing for fast approximate distance lookups  
- **No STL Containers**: Uses `dmArray<T>` and `dmHashTable<T>` for all data structures  
- **Memory Pre-allocation**: All arrays are pre-allocated at initialization; pathfinding uses only pre-allocated memory  
- **No Exceptions**: Uses explicit error codes instead of C++ exceptions

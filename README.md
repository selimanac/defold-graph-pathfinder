# A* Graph Pathfinding Defold Native Extension

A high-performance A* pathfinding library written in C++11, designed for real-time games and simulations with hundreds to thousands of moving objects. Built with a focus on performance, using flat array data structures and advanced caching mechanisms.

## Documentation

For full function details and usage examples, see the [API Reference](./API.md).  


## Status

This library has 3 parts:

#### Pathfinder

Core library. Responsible for managing nodes, edges, and pathfinding.

âœ… **Projected Pathfinding**  
âœ… **Min-Heap Priority Queue**  
âœ… **Path Caching**  
âœ… **Distance Caching**  
ðŸš§ **Smoothed Path Caching** - Not planned, maybe in the future

#### Path Smoothing

Responsible for existing path smoothing.  
Currently available path smoothing options:  

âœ… **BÃ©zier Quadratic**  
âœ… **BÃ©zier Adaptive**  
âœ… **Catmullâ€“Rom**  
âœ… **BÃ©zier Cubic**  
âœ… **Circular Arc**

#### Navigation

Responsible for enabling agents to navigate along the path.

ðŸš§ **Path Following** - WIP  
ðŸš§ **Dynamic Nodes**  
ðŸš§ **Path Invalidation**  
ðŸš§ **Group Assignment**  
ðŸš§ **Group Formation Patterns**  
ðŸš§ **Collision Avoidance** â€” Not planned, maybe in the future



### Supported Platforms

- **Desktop**: Linux (x86_64, arm64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), Windows (x86_64)
- **Mobile**: iOS (arm64, x86_64), Android (armv7, arm64)
- **Web**: JavaScript, WebAssembly (via Emscripten)

## Technical Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for real-time pathfinding with hundreds to thousands of moving objects  
- **A* Algorithm**: Classic A* with heuristics for optimal and efficient pathfinding  
- **Flat Array Architecture**: Cache-friendly memory layout using `dmArray<T>` from the Defold SDK  
- **Path Caching**: LRU cache with version-based invalidation for frequently reused paths  
- **Projected Pathfinding**: Supports pathfinding from arbitrary positions, not limited to graph nodes  
- **Dynamic Graph Updates**: Add or remove nodes and edges at runtime with automatic cache invalidation  
- **Min-Heap Priority Queue**: Custom implementation with zero-copy memory pooling and bulk operations  
- **Distance Caching**: Spatial hashing for fast approximate distance lookups  
- **No STL Containers**: Uses `dmArray<T>` and `dmHashTable<T>` for all data structures  
- **Memory Pre-allocation**: All arrays are pre-allocated at initialization; pathfinding uses only pre-allocated memory  
- **No Exceptions**: Uses explicit error codes instead of C++ exceptions
